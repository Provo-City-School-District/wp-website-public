<h2>Chromebook Software</h2>
<p>Provo City School District controls and monitors software on all Chromebooks. Software updates are sent out on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Blocked Content</h3>
<p>If your teacher posts a YouTube video for classroom study and the video is blocked by our filter, Please contact your teacher to have the block removed. The Learning Resource Officer at the school can also unblock it.</p>
<p>If you need a Chromebook app and it’s blocked, please request that it be unblocked through your teacher. Your teacher can submit a request to tech support.</p>
<h3>Zoom</h3>
<p>Zoom is an online video-conferencing application that teachers can use to communicate with students. Don’t try to install Zoom because it’s already installed on all Chromebooks. Your teacher will send you a meeting ID before you connect.</p>
