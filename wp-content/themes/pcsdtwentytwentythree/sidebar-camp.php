	<p>Big Springs is a unique and rare experience that provides opportunities which many children may never get in any other way. Located up the South Fork of Provo Canyon on a beautiful and secluded spot, we utilize trained leadership and the resources of our natural surroundings to contribute to each camper's mental, physical, and social growth.</p>
